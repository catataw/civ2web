# Description

This was my attempt at reverse engineering the epic turn-based strategy game, Civilization 2. It was my first attempt at creating a game, and the first time I've used BackBoneJS. I used CodeIgniter on the server side mostly as a way to build the CSS and JS files. The PHP server dependency can be removed. Local Storage is used to store settings and saved games. Please feel free to fork this. I don't have any plans to develop this at the moment.
